# Solana Protocol Architecture

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture of the Solana protocol implementation, following the Solana Protocol Architecture guidelines. The architecture is broken down into three main components, each with its own detailed diagram.

## 1. Program Structure

{{ include: diagrams/architecture/program-structure.mmd }}
```

### Key Components:
- **Token Program**: Handles token transfers, minting, and balance management
- **Staking Program**: Manages staking operations and reward calculations
- **Governance Program**: Handles proposal creation, voting, and execution

## 2. Account Structure

{{ include: diagrams/architecture/account-structure.mmd }}
```

### Account Types:
- **User Accounts**: Owned by users, contain SOL and token balances
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Stateless accounts managed by programs
- **System Accounts**: Core Solana system accounts and programs

## 3. External Integrations

```mermaid

```

### Integration Points:
- **Price Oracle**: Provides real-time price feeds for assets
- **Compliance Service**: Handles KYC/AML and regulatory requirements
- **Multi-sig Vault**: Enables secure, multi-signature transactions

## Flow Components

### Staking Flow
1. User deposits tokens into staking account
2. Staking program creates stake account
3. Rewards accrue based on staking duration
4. User can claim rewards or unstake tokens

### Governance Flow
1. Token holders create proposals
2. Voting period begins
3. Votes are tallied on-chain
4. Successful proposals are executed

## Security Considerations
- All programs implement proper access control
- Critical operations require proper authorization
- External calls are validated and rate-limited
- Comprehensive test coverage for all programs
